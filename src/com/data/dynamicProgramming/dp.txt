Steps to solving dynamic programming questions
1. Make it work
    - Visualize problem as a tree
    - Implement tree using recursion
    - Test it
2. Make it efficient
    - Add a memo object
    - Add a base case to return memo values
    - Store return values into the memo


    Tablulation recipe
1. visualize the problem as a table
2. size the table based on inputs
3. initialize table with default values
4. seed the trivial answer into the table
5. iterate through the table
6. fill the table based on the current position
